# Excel-Dashboard
This project involves creating an interactive dashboard to analyze and visualize bike sales data. The dashboard provides insights into various aspects of the sales, such as customer demographics, purchasing behavior, and regional trends.

Key Features
Average Income Per Purchase:

Visualization: Bar chart showing the average income of customers who purchased bikes versus those who did not, segmented by gender.
Insight: Male customers have a higher average income compared to female customers, and customers who purchased bikes generally have a higher income than those who did not.
Customer Commute:

Visualization: Line chart depicting the count of purchased bikes against different commute distances.
Insight: Most customers who purchased bikes commute less than 1 mile or more than 10 miles, while those who did not purchase bikes commute across various distances without a clear pattern.
Customer Age Brackets:

Visualization: Line chart illustrating the distribution of bike purchases across different age ranges.
Insight: Middle-aged customers are more likely to purchase bikes compared to adolescents and older customers.
Region-wise Car Owners:

Visualization: Bar chart displaying the sum of car owners segmented by region and gender.
Insight: North America has the highest number of car owners, with a significant difference between male and female car owners.

Filters and Interactivity
Marital Status: Allows filtering the data based on the marital status of the customers (Married or Single).
Region: Enables selection of different regions (Europe, North America, Pacific) to analyze regional trends.
Gender: Provides an option to filter data based on gender (Female, Male).
Technical Details


Tools Used: Microsoft Excel for data analysis and dashboard creation.
Data Source: The dataset used for this analysis includes customer information such as income, commute distance, age, region, gender, marital status, and whether they purchased a bike.
Data Visualization: Various charts (bar charts, line charts) are used to represent the data visually for easier interpretation and analysis.


Conclusion
The Bike Sales Dashboard provides comprehensive insights into customer purchasing behavior, demographic trends, and regional differences. This project showcases proficiency in data analysis, visualization, and the ability to derive actionable insights from data
